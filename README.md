# Creating an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files in C Language

## The Project
This project is a creation of interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

###### Use
This program is run with a readable monty (.m) file as it's argument.
The program then interprets the instructions given in the file and
completes instructions according to given opcodes. If instructions are
not valid, or if an error occurs, the program stop running and prints an
error message to stderr.

###### Get Started
To use this Monty ByteCode interpreter program, simply run:
$ ./monty <filename.m>

If given a valid monty file, the program will then run and interpret
the file line by line.
